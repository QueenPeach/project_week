#Communication
-We will communicate in person during the hours we are all in the Code Fellows
 building.
-Otherwise, we will communicate over Slack or text when separate.
-We will meet every morning and first discuss the project progression and what
 still needs to be done.
-Everyone is completely welcome to voice their opinions on the project.

#Conflict Resolution
-If someone has a conflict, they can mention it to the group and we will all
 work through it together.  
 -Involve a TA or the teacher to help resolve issues if we can't resolve them  
 as a group first.  

#Work Plan
-We will try to break work down into tasks that are relatively reasonable in
 size and divide up the work between each other.
-We will pair program when possible on Javascript & CSS and trade partners
 when a task is complete.
-Tasks will be evenly divided to ensure everyone will have something
 interesting to solve.

#Git Process
-When pair programming have any of the other two people take a look at the PR with  
fresh eyes.
-Steve merges all PRs, or under Steve's advisement we can merge PRs.

#Anything Else
-We will try to honor the 15 minute rule.
