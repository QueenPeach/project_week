#Communication
-We will communicate in person during the hours we are all in the Code Fellows
 building.
-Otherwise, we will communicate over Slack or text when separate.
-We will meet every morning and first discuss the project progression and what
 still needs to be done.
-Everyone is completely welcome to voice their opinions on the project.

#Conflict Resolution
-If someone has a conflict, they can mention it to the group and we will all
 work through it together.

#Work Plan
-Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are
complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how
you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS,
and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.

#Git Process
-Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who
merges PRs?

#Anything Else
-Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup
times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
