#Communication
-We will communicate in person during the hours we are all in the Code Fellows
 building.
-Otherwise, we will communicate over Slack or text when separate.
-We will meet every morning and first discuss the project progression and what
 still needs to be done.
-Everyone is completely welcome to voice their opinions on the project.

#Conflict Resolution
-If someone has a conflict, they can mention it to the group and we will all
 work through it together.

#Work Plan
-We will try to break work down into tasks that are relatively reasonable in
 size and divide up the work between each other.
-We will pair program when possible on Javascript & CSS and trade partners
 when a task is complete.
-Tasks will be evenly divided to ensure everyone will have something
 interesting to solve.

#Git Process
-Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who
merges PRs?

#Anything Else
-Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup
times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
