#User Stories
##User Scenarios
I like beer. Therefore, my idea for a site is some sort of Happy Hour tracker that could work with your zip code. It can list all business around your area and specify searches with Happy Hour times, prices and menus. Some places start at 3:00, end at 6:00. Some places start at 2:00 and end at 7:00. Some have their food menu HH end earlier than their drink menu. Some have happy hour all day on specific days of the week. Some places have both early and late happy hours, I want to know what time they start, and if they have food, what kind of cuisine is it. Some places don't offer discounts on beer, I want to know what these places are so I can never go there. I want to be able to put in a mileage radius from my current position to better fine-tune my searches rather just a broad search with zip codes. Maybe I want to know which places offer wi-fi, which places are dog friendly. Can I write code on my laptop inside this business with a delicious and cheap IPA and my dog Chloe by my side? That would be ideal. Add more specifications like searching specifically for breweries or cafe's or dive bars or places open past 12:00am, etc. K that's enough for now. Don't steal my idea.
